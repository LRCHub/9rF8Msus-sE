The Curtains have been closed.
I wait for them to open.
A shadow on the stage appears.
My movement feeling frozen.
As I walk to the edge.
The faces all below me.
Looking up into my eyes.
I'm no longer lonely.
On the stage. United we are one
Sea of lights. Shining like the sun.
Mind and body. Our presence will be heard.
Screaming faces. Sing to me with my own words.
My ears begin to ring.
The music in my veins.
In front of you, I give myself.
I'll share with you my pain.
But I will bring you hope.
Even when you're down.
Cause everything will be ok when we come to your town.
