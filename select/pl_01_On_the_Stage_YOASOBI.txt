Imagining a moment yet to come
My eyes are locked and fixed on visions I've
drawn
Of the future me that I pursue
I know it is about to vanish from my view
An overlap ensues
Oh, I believe so
Arriving at the future that I saw
Among so many options, made up my mind
All because, from when I started
I knew in my heart, I could not conceive
anything but this
I didn't wanna lose to anyone
So, even in the rough, no giving up
I still kept on running strong
I could endure all, I could endure all
I see, I cannot make it if passion is all I got
In this domain where you either lose or win
It's all about the achievement
No, it's not a joke
I understand it all the same
But I stayed, for the flame inside, fueling my
passion
With every day I gotta fight
My every action is building up into the outcome
I wanted
I know it's true
So, I'm standing on top of the stage of my
dreams
And the challenge is signaled by my heartbeat
Time after time
Been imagining this moment
Outdoing all versions of me, you will see
Taking a deep breath, inhale and exhale
When I'm raising my gaze, and see what unveils
Every day I spent with a scab has untied
The moment I am living now, as it betides
So now, I face the scene I have been dreaming of
I can see it unfold before my eyes
Got so numb and frozen, when facing that
absurdity at times
While others would be saying whatever they want
Lost sight of the reason I've been fighting for
and the goal I was chasing
Even then, I thought 'come on, one more time'
I could reach out, and I never gave up
Cause, beside me, always fighting through the
daring pain
You were there right from the start
Set on the stage I have dreamt of
I finally reached it
And now I review the path I have pursued
Time after time, I shed so many tears
But each time I stood back up, my will was
renewed
Taking a deep breath, inhale and exhale
And slowly my eyes open, sight unveils
I take a step and
I'm going to meet with the future self I
imagined that I could be
So, I'm standing on top of the stage of my
dreams
And now the signal echoes loud in my ears
Time after time, been imagining this moment
Outdoing all versions of me, I'll prevail
Taking a deep breath, inhale and exhale
And in silence I raise my gaze, it unveils
Everything I've done up to this point in time
I realize wasn't in vain, but led to now
No doubt, the future that I have seen in my
dreams
Has started now, unfolding where I stand
So, the scenery I have been dreaming of
The future self I pictured then, is right there
in my sight
It's a moment that I'll seize tight
