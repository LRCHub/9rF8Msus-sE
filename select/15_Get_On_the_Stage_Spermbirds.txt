You're just as important as we are
This much we know is true
So why don't you get up here
And tell us what matters to you

I'm not talkin' 'bout playin' rock star
It comes down to supporting the scene
'Cause you've all got your own opinions
Whether you're 40 or 17

A life to waste, no way
Facts to face, right now
Try something new, right now
I'm telling you, right now

Decide what you want
Unlock your cage
Make a difference
Get on the stage
Find your potential
There's no minimum age
Don't live in the dirt
Get on the stage

Your right to self expression
Your responsibility to use
In a band or a demonstration
Let someone else know your views

It's important everybody contributes
Anyone can help turn the page
And that's the best thing about punk rock
Anyone can get on the stage

A life to waste, no way
Facts to face, right now
Try something new, right now
I'm telling you, right now

Decide what you want
Unlock your cage
Make a difference
And get on the stage
Find your potential
There's no minimum age
Don't live in the dirt
Get on the stage
