Did you say she asked about me today?
I guess that she heard of the records I've made.
Tell her I've found money but I ain't found the time,
But she's still the star on the stage of my mind.
Since you mentioned her who I already miss,
The look of her smile and the touch of her kiss,
And I thought I was through with feeling like this,

But in this point in time, she's the star on the stage of my mind.
The runway lights whisper as the plane passes by.
Where's the dark-haired young lover that was with you last time?
The stewardess smiles and the first class seat cries,
Cause to all others I'm blind for she's still the star on the stage of my mind.
Tell her I've found money but I ain't found the time
